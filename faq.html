            <li><b>What genres of movies does your studio produce?</b> We make exiting movies for teens, full of teamwork and conflict! Although it is hard to pinpoint exact genres because the MugCatStudios team likes lots of different types of movies, I would say we do drama, action, thriller...</li>
